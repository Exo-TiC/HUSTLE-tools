    "HUSTLE-tools operates using configuration files, designated with the .hustle file extension. Each .hustle file controls one Stage of HUSTLE-tools. .hustle files are more human-readable than raw code and they allow you to easily reproduce previous runs of HUSTLE-tools as well as rapidly share your reduction and analysis methods with your colleagues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we need to make our Stage 3 .hustle file. The next cell contains a template stage_3.hustle file which you can modify to run Stage 3 of HUSTLE-tools. We're going to modify it so that it bins the 1D spectra from the HUSTLE program observations of the hot Jupiter WASP-127b that we downloaded in Stage 0, reduced in Stage 1, and extracted from in Stage 2. To make it do this, make the following changes to the .hustle file template:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set topleveldir to 'tutorial' and input_run to the string 'extraction_1' so we can use our extracted spectra from the last Stage.\n",
    "2. Set output_run to the string 'bin_1' to keep our different extraction attempts separated.\n",
    "3. Set the verbose, show_plots, and save_plots variables to each be 0, 1, or 2. verbose controls how many printed statements the pipeline produces, letting you keep track of what the pipeline is doing and what step it is on. show_plots allows the pipeline to temporarily pause execution to show you an interactive plot. save_plots saves output .png or .gif files for plots and other graphics produced. 0 prints/shows/saves nothing, while 2 prints/shows/saves everything.\n",
    "4. Set bin_method to \"wavelengths\" to bin based on wavelengths rather than on detector columns.\n",
    "5. Set wavelength_bins to np.arange(2000,8100,100). This tells HUSTLE-tools to bin data from 2000 to 8000 AA in bins of width 100 AA or 10 nm, which will produce 60 light curves in all.\n",

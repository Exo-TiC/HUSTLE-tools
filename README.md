v0.2: Re-branded release of the HUSTLE-tools pipeline with updated tutorials and commands

V0.1: First release of the HUSTLE-tools pipeline (previously ExoTiC-UVIS) to download, sort, and analyse Hubble WFC3/UVIS G280 spectra

The pipeline is based on combining two codes ``Hazelnut`` ([@AbbyBoehm](https://github.com/AbbyBoehm)) and ``lluvia`` ([@CarlosGascon](https://github.com/CarlosGascon)) into a single package that allows the user to choose which steps in the process they use.

This work is part of the HUSTLE (Hubble UV-optical Survey of Transiting Legacy Exoplanets) Treasury Program from the Hubble Space Telescope GO-17183 (PI [@hrwakeford](https://github.com/hrwakeford))

The steps in this pipeline can be found in [Boehm et al. (2024, AJ)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025AJ....169...23B/abstract) and [Gasc√≥n et al. (2025, AJ)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19193).
